# Lesson 1 - Installation & Hello World
## (1) Installation & Setup
The following steps are used to setup ``react`` with a simple project.

1. Update or install ``npm``.

    ```
    npm install -g npm
    ```


2. Confirm ``npm`` and ``node`` version.

    ```
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```


3. Install react globally

    ```
    npm install -g create-react-app
    ```


4. Confirm ``react`` version.

    ```
    create-react-app --version
    ```


5. Go to your developers directory

    ```
    cd ~/javascript/bcinnovationlabs
    ```

7. Now we will create our first ``react`` app using the installer.

    ```
    create-react-app lesson-01
    ```

8. Go into our new app!

    ```
    cd ~/lesson-01
    ```

## (2) Usage

1. Try running the application for the first time.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. You should see the app loaded in your browser at the following URL.

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

3. To run the unit tests, run the following command.

    ```
    npm test
    ```

4. To build the application for production, run the following.

    ```
    npm run build
    ```
